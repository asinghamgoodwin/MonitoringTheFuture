title: "Variable name mapping -> visualizing time trends"
output: github_document
---
My goal here is to combine code from different places for a proof-of-concept: to see whether I can quickly go from raw MTF data to a visualisation of a time trend for a given variable. To start off with, a couple limitations will be:

* Only using variables included in grade 12, file 1
* Only looking at one variable over time, with everyone's responses
* I'm not doing any checks, tests, or validation of anything (so don't rely on any of the information from this!)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
require(haven)
require(stringr)
```

# Code

This chunk includes:

1. A helper function which tries to standardize varable labels from MTF datasets across years.
2. A function that creates a table that maps standardized labels to variable names to years, so we can use it to look up something like "was `age` asked in 2014? what was the column called?"

*Note: I couldn't get it to work with `source()` in the files, but ideally I'd like these split up?*
```{r code=xfun::read_utf8('../tools/mapping-variable-names-to-labels/create-mapping.R')}
```

This function takes a mapping like we created above, and gets all of the MTF data that the user wants, based on the years and variables that they specify.
```{r code=xfun::read_utf8('../tools/creating-datasets/get-specific-data-by-years.R')}
```

This function takes a database, variable inside that database, and an encoding, and makes a plot of prevalence over time.
```{r code=xfun::read_utf8('../tools/visualization/plot-prevalence-over-time.R')}
```

# Results

Putting it all together (examples of some standard substance use questions, from file 1):

Here are the numbers from the [NIH website](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/trends-statistics/monitoring-future/monitoring-future-study-trends-in-prevalence-various-drugs), just to verify we're getting similar ones!

Next step: getting longer time trends for some of the social/gender questions I'm interested in:
